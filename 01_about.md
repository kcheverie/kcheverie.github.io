Graphic designer with a decade of experience, excited to delve into the world of front-end development.

The bulk of my experience is in print. When I moved to the world of web, it sparked a new interest in the way design can be a tool for communication.   I want to make web applications that are robust, beautiful, and create a great experience for the user.

Other interests include urbanism, vintage shopping and karaoke.
